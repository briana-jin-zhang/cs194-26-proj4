    <h1>Face Morphing</h1>
    <p>
        This project involved me morphing my face with a man named george. By doing this a sufficiently
        number of times, I was able to create a gif of a gradual morph. Later, I compute the mean neutral 
        and mean smiling face from the FEI face database. From those means, I extrapolate a caricature of 
        myself smiling. At the very end, I did miscellaneous things such as remorphing the caricature, 
        changing the gender of my face, and computing the PCA of the neutral faces.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Defining Correspondences</h2>
    <p>
        First, I had to pick the points that would define the features of the human face.
        I also aligned the images so that the eyes would be roughly in the same position.
        Experimentally, I displayed what the Delaunay triangulation over the faces would appear.

    <h2>Computing the Midway Face</h2>
    <p>
        In order to compute the midway face, I first computed the midway shape by 
        averaging the points selected on my face and george's and then calculated
        the Delaunay triangulation over the new points. I apply affine transformations
        between my and george's Delaunay triangulations to the midway's and average the 
        colors.

    <h2>The Morph Sequence</h2>
    <p>
        I simply applied what I did to compute the mean face except I adjusted the weight 
        of the first and second image when averaging the points and colors. One thing I did 
        change was the process of computation in terms of code, changing from iteration to 
        array manipulation as it was faster. Previously, it took a minute or so for a single 
        computation. Now, it was faster to compute 45 morphs than the single morph from before.
        Through this, I am able to create a gif of george's face morphing into mine.

    <h2>The "Mean face" of a population</h2>
    <p>
        The FEI Face database had both smiling and neutral faces that already had points chosen.
        Below is an example of one such pairing.
    </p>

            </div>
        </div>
    <p>
        I computed the mean face by first computing its shape via an average of the given data points
        I then morphed a few of the faces into the average shape.

            </div>
        </div>
    <p>
        By morphing all the images to the average shape and averaging the colors, I was able to compute
        the mean face of both neutral and smiling faces. 
    </p>
        <div class = 'container'>
            <div class='imgContainer'>

            <div class='imgContainer'> 
                <img src="images/fei2.png" width=300>
            </div>
        </div>
    <p>
        I warped my own face to the average shapes to get this ugly result.
    </p>
        <div class = 'container'>
            <div class='imgContainer'>
                <img src="images/me_to_mid_a.png" width=300>
            </div>

            <div class='imgContainer'> 
                <img src="images/me_to_mid_b.png" width=300>
            </div>
        </div>

    <p>
        Similarly, I warped the average faces to my own face shape.
    </p>
    <div class = 'container'>
        <div class='imgContainer'>
            <img src="images/mid_to_me_a.png" width=300>
        </div>

        <div class='imgContainer'> 
            <img src="images/mid_to_me_b.png" width=300>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        I believe the warp was very distorted because my face shape is pretty different from the average shape.
        This is especially apparent when it comes to the warps between smiling shapes and my shape. 
        For instance, my lips are smaller than the average face, so when it got warped, it became much larger.
        This was even more exacerbated by the smiling face, since the edges of the mouths are much bigger
        for the smile. When the smiling average was warped to my face, the mouth becomes comically small 
        for the same reason. 
    </p>

    </div>

    <h2>Caricatures: Extrapolating from the mean</h2>
    <p>
        I can artificially make my face smile by taking the difference between 
        the smiling and neutral averages, then adding to my own face. This was 
        done while in the average face shape so that they are added in the same space.
    </p>

            <img src="images/artificial_warped_smile.png" width=300>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        Experimentally, I warped this result back to my own face shape. I also tried first
        warping the delta between the smiling and neutral face first, then adding to my own face.
        Both yielded the same result.
    </p>

    </div>

    <h2> Gender Swap </h2>

    <p>
        Using the same technique, I tried to create a more feminized version of 
        me and a male version of me. To get better results, I used the average 
        chinese male and female face in order to not run into the problem I had 
        with the brazilian dataset, that my face was too different.
    </p>

    <p>
        First, I computed the average shape using points I selected on the average 
        chinese male and female faces. Then, I warped all the faces to that middle shape.
    </p>

            <img src="images/aligned_gender_me.jpg" width=300>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        Interestingly, the average male and female's faces did not change too much, 
        whereas mine already looks a little more male. I do the same thing as I did 
        for the previous caricature, which is adding the dx of male to female to myself
        in the same face shape. Then I warp it to the male face shape.
    </p>

            <img src="images/male_me.png" width=300>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        I was rather pleased with the result. 
        I repeat the same process to create a more feminine me. 
        This time I am less successful.
    </p>

    <div class = 'container'>
        <div class='imgContainer'>
            <img src="images/warped_feminine_me.png" width=300>
        </div>

        <div class='imgContainer'> 
            <img src="images/feminine_me.png" width=300>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        I believe the reason why it did not feminize me more is because my face 
        is already fairly similar to the average female face. The only noticeable
        difference is that my eyes are slightly bigger now, but my face is 
        also wider.
    </p>

    <h2>PCA</h2>
    <p>
        Something else I decided to try was to make an eigenbasis for faces 
        based off of the FEI neutral faces. I simply did an SVD decomposition. 
        Here are the first few eigenfaces.
    </p>

        Lastly, one thing I did was collaborate with other students to create a 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3vouduLS3w&feature=emb_title">video</a> 
        of our faces all morphing into each others. This was my contribution.
